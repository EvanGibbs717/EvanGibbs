Hello and welcome to the page! I am Evan Gibbs, and this site is here as (1) a showcase of what I do and (2) a little hobby and repository for things I care about. I completed my undergrad in Mathematics at York College of Pennsylvania under my advisor Dr. Haiping Yuan and am currently transitioning into a Ph.D. in Mathematics beginning Fall 2026. (Very) broadly, I am interested in mathematical ecology and infectious disease modeling. If you want to learn more about this, you can check out my "Research and Academics" and "Research Projects" tabs. Much of my interest in these topics comes from my rural background in Pennsylvania where I spent most of my time fishing, hiking, and appreciating nature. The outdoors hold a very special and dear place in my heart, and as such, I believe the conservation of our Earth is crucially important. Mathematics can play a critical role in protecting and guiding conservation strategies, as well as making locations more hospitable and enjoyable for humans (i.e. think of how infectious disease modeling can help prevent disease and guide disease intervention programs). It can also be a strong motivator and guide for influencing policy related to such topics. My dream is to combine these three domains of mathematics, nature, and people (more generally, government and wildlife organizations), so that I can develop generalizable mathematical frameworks that help ecologists (1) protect and revitalize our natural resources and land, (2) ensure a future where humans can enjoy these locations, and (3) provide a mathematical justification for environmental policies and decisions. I am still very much a baby in this field but am excited to keep learning!
